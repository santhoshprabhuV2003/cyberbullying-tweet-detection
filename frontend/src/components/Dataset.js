                    <p>Dataset consists of two columns: tweet_text and cyberbullying_type. This dataset contains 47692 tweets and cyberbullying_type is labelled according to the class of cyberbullying: Age, Ethnicity, Gender, Religion, Other type of cyberbullying, Not cyberbullying. The data has been balanced in order to contain ~8000 of each class. As mentioned by the authors in Kaggle, these tweets either describe a bullying event or are the offense themselves, therefore explore it to the point where you feel comfortable.</p>
